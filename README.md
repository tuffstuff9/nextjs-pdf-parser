# Next.js PDF Parser Template 📄🔍

## Introduction

I was having some trouble parsing PDFs in Next.js, so I thought I would make this template for anyone else who was facing the same issues as me. I hope this template saves you some time and trouble. It's a basic `create-next-app` with PDF parsing implemented using the [pdf2json library](https://github.com/modesty/pdf2json) and file uploading facilitated by [FilePond](https://github.com/pqina/react-filepond).

## Installation & Setup 🚀

1.  **Clone the repository**:
2.  `git clone [repository-url]`
3.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
4.  `cd nextjs-pdf-parser`
5.  **Install dependencies**:
6.  ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
7.  **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage 🖱

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and use the FilePond uploader to select and upload a PDF. Once uploaded, the content of the PDF is parsed and printed to the server console (Note: it will not be printed to the browser log).

## Technical Details 🛠

- **nodeUtil is not defined Error**:

  To bypass the `nodeUtil is not defined` error, the following configuration was added to `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2json'],
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

    See more details [here](https://github.com/modesty/pdf2json/issues/303)

- **Blank output from `pdfParser.getRawTextContent()`**:

  This issue might be due to incorrect type definitions. There are two potential solutions:

  1.  **Fix TypeScript definitions**: Update the type definition for PDFParser.

  2.  **Bypass type checking**: Instantiate PDFParser as shown:

      `const pdfParser = new (PDFParser as any)(null, 1);`
